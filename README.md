# Data Export and Import Project
This project implements a Data Export and Import functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to effortlessly export their data to a CSV file and import data back from CSV files. Whether managing lists or working with spreadsheets, this project streamlines tasks effectively.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed before setting up the project:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

# Approach
Follow these steps to implement the Data Export and Import Project:

__Organize Project Structure:__ Start by organizing your project into a directory. Create separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to maintain a clean and modular codebase.

__HTML Input Tag:__ In your HTML file, create an input tag to accept the input file, and also create a button to export the file.

__CSS Styling:__ Enhance the user interface by applying CSS styles. Utilize CSS rules to control the appearance of elements, making the application visually appealing. Create a separate styles.css file for this purpose.

__JavaScript Export Function:__ Define a function in your JavaScript file (script.js) for exporting data to a CSV file. This function should convert the data to CSV format. Utilize JavaScriptâ€™s File API or libraries like Parse for CSV handling.

__JavaScript Import Logic:__ Implement JavaScript logic for importing data from a CSV file. Ensure your code can read and parse the CSV file. Libraries like PapaParse can simplify this process.

__Export Button:__ Create a button in the export section of your HTML for users to initiate the export process. Attach an event listener to this button that calls your export function when clicked.

__CSV Data Handling:__ Implement logic within your import and export functions to handle CSV data. For exporting, convert data into CSV format, and for importing, parse the CSV data into a usable format for your application.
